"""A region still being drawn: `aria-busy` on it at once, a spinner once it has taken a
while, and neither after the work ends, however it ends.

The spinner goes in with the mark. How long it stays hidden is the stylesheet's
(`.console-busy`), not a timer here. Work that overlaps on one region shares one mark and
one spinner, and the region is let go when the last of it ends.
