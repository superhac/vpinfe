# The 2.x visual treatment, from manager.css: a synthwave grid over the page, and the
# table's own row colors. AG Grid reads its palette from --ag-* custom properties, so
# the brand values are mapped onto those rather than restyling any of its parts.
# The design tokens. Everything below refers to these rather than to a hex or a pixel
# count, so a decision about the palette or the type scale is made once.
# The Synthwave palette: every color and every effect, and nothing else. A mode is
