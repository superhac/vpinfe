"""A real theme, in a real browser, against a real backend.

Every other test in this suite asserts on a piece. The breaks that reached the cabinet
were between the pieces, and all of them were only visible by looking: two hardcoded
`(bg|dmd|table)` lists meant no contract 2 theme could run at all while 907 Python and 95
JavaScript tests stayed green, and the next session found six more the same way.

So this starts `main.py --headless` against a throwaway library, opens the harness theme
in headless Chromium, and asserts the things a screenshot would have shown: the wheel
rendered, every request the page made returned a status, the media a theme asks for by
kind resolves, and moving the wheel moves it.

Skipped where there is no browser, so it never becomes the reason a Windows build fails.
