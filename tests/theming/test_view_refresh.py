"""Re-deriving the wheel's view after something changed the library underneath it.

A view is a collection resolved over game objects, and both go stale from outside: a
finished session moves a game up a LastRun wheel, and a Manager UI edit replaces the game
object rather than mutating the one the view holds. Rebuilding only the payload leaves
every one of those showing what it showed at boot.
