"""The committed theme payload fixture still matches what the builder produces.

The JavaScript tests in tests/js/ read that fixture. Nothing else connects the two

asserting the old shape and passing - which is the drift that let a media key lookup
reach the cabinet broken.

When this fails, regenerate and re-run the JS tests:
