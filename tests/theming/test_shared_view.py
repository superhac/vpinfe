"""One view, however many windows are showing it.

A cabinet opens three windows onto one library. They were three independent copies that
happened to agree - each re-read the library, re-sorted it, rebuilt its own entry list
and serialized its own payload. Only the controller window takes input, so only one of
them could ever change what they were all deriving.

What is asserted here is that they now share it: one derivation, one payload, and a
change made through any window visible from all of them.
