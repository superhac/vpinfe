"""Render the Console in a language where every catalog entry is unreadable.

The AST checks answer "is there a literal in a display position?" - and four rounds of
this work showed that a string can reach the screen without ever being one: through a
constant, a dict value, a function's return, a component the check was never told about.
This asks the only question that catches all of those at once: **what English is still on
screen when every word the catalog owns has been mangled?**

It found the entire navigation rail, which four passes of static checking had called
clean.
