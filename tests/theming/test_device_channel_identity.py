"""Who may claim to be a window.

A client named itself in the query string and the channel believed it. Two consequences,
both reached live during a diagnostic session rather than in theory:

  - Any name was accepted, including one this process never opened.
  - A second client naming an open window *replaced* it. The real window's events went
    to the impostor, and the impostor inherited its whole API surface - `shutdown_system`
    and `build_metadata` included.

Every real window is registered before its browser is launched, so the set of valid names
is known up front and neither needed a new mechanism to fix.
