A folder carries its id, so this means the same game is in the library twice - a copy,
or one tree reached through two configured locations. The old answer was to re-mint the
loser, which is a write to somebody's file to settle something only they can decide: it
makes the copy a different game for good, and anything that named it goes with it.
