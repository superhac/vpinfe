"""The token layer, checked. It had no test and it decayed.

In a few weeks the stylesheet grew four tokens nothing referenced and one that was
referenced and never defined - `var(--warn)`, which resolves to nothing, so a menu item
meant to read as destructive drew in the inherited color instead. Nothing failed,
because nothing was looking.

Three rules, and they are the seam the tokenizing pass needs under it: every `var()`
resolves, every token has a user, and a color is named rather than typed.
