"""Captures the user-visible behavior of a VPinFE tree, for the 3.0 parity gate.

Run against master it produces the baseline; run against vpinfe-3.0 the gate
compares the two. Every difference must be named in docs/compatibility-3.0.md
or the gate fails - that is the whole mechanism behind "users notice nothing".

Works on both the 2.x and 3.0 layouts, importing from the tree it is run in
(cwd), so the same file can capture either side:

    python tests/parity_capture.py --out baseline.json      # from a checkout's root

Not a test; tests/test_parity.py drives it in a subprocess.
