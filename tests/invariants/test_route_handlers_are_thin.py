"""Route handlers call a service and shape a response, and do not hold logic themselves.

`docs/conventions.md` says logic belongs in a service where the other callers can reach it.
It had not been checked, and `httpapi/` had become the place the logic lived: a hundred and
eleven handlers carried more than a few lines each, `games.py` was the de facto service layer
with ten sibling modules importing its private helpers, and the tests, the extension
operations and one route calling another all reached into handlers because that was the only
way to reach the code inside them.

The line count is a smell test rather than a rule - a handler is thin because it delegates,
not because it is short. It works here because the shape is unambiguous: of a hundred and
sixty-one handlers, four in five are one or two lines, and the ones listed below are the
whole tail. A new handler that lands above the line is not necessarily wrong, but it has to
say why here first.
