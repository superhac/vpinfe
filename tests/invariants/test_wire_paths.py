"""A relative path leaves this codebase forward-slashed, whatever host built it.

`str()` on a `Path` and `os.path.relpath` both answer in the *host's* separator. The
values they build are read somewhere else - an API payload, a zip entry, an `.info` key -
so the same library described itself as `medias/bg.png` on Linux and `medias\\bg.png` on
Windows, and only Windows CI ever said so.

That is the trap this file exists for: **the mistake is invisible on the machine that
makes it.** Four sites had it at once and three others next to them were already correct,
so the rule was known and simply not applied. A test that runs everywhere catches it at
the point it is written rather than an hour later in someone else's CI.

The check is per function: if a function builds a relative path, it has to normalize
somewhere in the same function. That allows the shape `rel = os.path.relpath(...)` used a
line later inside an f-string that ends `.replace(os.sep, "/")`, which is how several
correct call sites are written.
