"""What we serve over HTTP is snake_case, including the aliases.

`docs/conventions.md` settles the choice: snake_case matches Python, so nothing is
translated at the boundary, and it matches the JSON the app already returned. The models are
clean today and nothing was holding them there - a single `camelCase` field would be a
contract a client has to special-case forever, because a name on the wire cannot be taken
back without breaking whoever read it.

`populate_by_name` means a field can carry an alias, and the alias is what a client
actually sees, so both spellings are checked.
