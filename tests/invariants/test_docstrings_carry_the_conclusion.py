"""A docstring states what the code does now, not what it did before or what proved it.

`docs/conventions.md` puts the argument, the alternatives and the measurements in the
commit message, which is where somebody looks when they ask why. The code gets the
conclusion.

The edit hook already quotes an over-long docstring back. It reads the lines a call adds,
so it sees a docstring once and never again: anything dismissed at that moment, or written
before the rule, is invisible from then on. That is how a residue builds up under a check
that reports clean. This is the half that reads what is already here.

Only the two halves a checker can be sure of. History and a measurement are objective -
either a sentence describes a shape that no longer exists, or it does not. The argument
behind a decision is the larger half of the rule and it stays a judgment, because a check
that fires on prose that is fine is one everybody learns to wave through.
