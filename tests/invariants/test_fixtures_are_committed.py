"""Every file under `tests/fixtures/` is committed, and git is not ignoring one.

`.gitignore` excludes `*.json` and names the exceptions, because config, logs and caches
are JSON and there are far more of those than fixtures worth keeping. The cost is that
adding a fixture without its negation fails **silently**: the file is on the author's
disk, every test passes, and a clean checkout is missing it. That has nearly happened
three times.

This is the check that makes it loud. It reads git rather than the filesystem, so it sees
what a clean checkout would.
