"""No year this project hands out is a float.

Chris, 2026-09-10: *"At the end of that day, nothing should make it a float."* Whether a
given year is a number or text is a per-surface answer and not settled here - the library
hands out text, a catalog's own year comes back as a number - but a float is neither of
those and is nobody's answer.

It arrives from a coercion rather than from data: a year is parsed to compare or sort it,
`float()` is the coercion that never raises, and the value goes on to be serialized. That
happened once already, in the connector that fetches a rating, where JavaScript's single
number type had hidden it.
