"""The shim registry has to describe the shims that exist.

A list of compatibility promises is only worth having if it cannot quietly go stale, so
each check here turns one of the ways it could into a failure:

  - a shim in the registry that no longer matches the code it points at
  - a shim with no ledger entry, which is how the window messages shipped half-done:
    the handoff cited PAR-24 and the ledger stopped at PAR-23
  - a name the docs promise themes that the code does not actually emit, which is the
    launch-event bug exactly - docs/theme.md told themes to match one spelling while
    play_events.py broadcast the other alone

The registry itself is common/deprecations.py.
