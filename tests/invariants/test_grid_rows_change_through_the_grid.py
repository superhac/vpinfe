"""A Console grid's rows change through `grid.transact`, in the list the grid was built
from, and nowhere else.

A selection is resolved against the rows the grid was built from. A transaction sent
past `transact`, or applied to some other list, changes the screen and leaves those rows
as they were, so a bulk action acts on a row as it was before the edit.
