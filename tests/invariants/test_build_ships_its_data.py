"""Everything the app reads at runtime that is not Python is in the build.

PyInstaller follows imports and nothing else, so a data file reaches a release only if
`packaging/vpinfe.spec` names a root above it. The failure is a missing image or a key on
screen in a release artifact, found by a person looking at a cabinet and never by a red
suite.

The spec lists roots and PyInstaller takes each one whole, so a new file under an existing
root needs nothing. What needs saying is a new *owner*.
