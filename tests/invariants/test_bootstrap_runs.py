"""The suite's own bootstrap ran, so its guards are actually in place.

`python -m unittest discover tests` makes `tests/` the top-level directory, so the group
folders load as `api.*` and `config.*` and `tests/__init__.py` is never imported - which
is where the power guard is installed.

Run the suite as `python -m unittest discover -t . -s tests`.
