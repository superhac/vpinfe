"""What Python names, Python spells: `snake_case`, everywhere we define a name.

`docs/conventions.md` settles it - functions, methods, variables and arguments are
`snake_case`, classes are `CapWords`, constants are `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. PEP 8 allows
camelCase "only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style", which was the
argument for the 2.x names, and they are gone.

The wire is a separate question and has its own gate. A published theme reads
`gameDirName` off a contract 1 row and always will; `game_dir_name` is the attribute
behind it. This checks what we *define*, never what we serve, so the two can differ
without either one drifting.

`ruff`'s `N` rules cover most of this and block in CI. They do not cover a PascalCase
dataclass field - `BGImagePath` sat on `Game` for two years without a single finding -
so the rule is stated here in full rather than assumed.
