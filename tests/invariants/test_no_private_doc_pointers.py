"""Tracked code does not point at a document only one machine can read.

The design notes live outside the clone and are not published. A reference to one tells a
reader something exists, names it, and then cannot show it to them - which is worse than
saying nothing, because the reason is now somewhere they cannot go.

A PreToolUse hook already refuses a write that adds one. It checks what a call adds, so it
cannot see what predates it: two survived in `tests/` for weeks until a sweep found them.
This is the half that looks at what is already here.

It reads each file as one run of text rather than line by line. A pointer that wraps -
"(MEDIA decisions" ending a line and "6-8)" starting the next - is invisible to a check
that matches within a line, and is the same pointer.

The rule, in `docs/conventions.md`: state the reason instead. If the reason is too long to
state, it belongs in the design note alone and the code says nothing.
