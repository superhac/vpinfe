"""Nothing from anybody's own library is in the public tree.

Chris, 2026-09-10: *"None of my library assets or metadata are allowed in the public
repo."* This tree is public and the machines it gets developed against are not. A real
frontend install is the best possible test corpus and the worst possible thing to commit
from, and the two facts pull in opposite directions every time somebody works from one.

So the rule is that **format facts cross and data does not**. Key names, encodings,
layering rules, the casing traps - those are facts about PinballY and VPinMAME, and they
belong here. A table list, a rating, a play count, a high score, a media file, a path off
somebody's drive: none of it, in any form, including trimmed or anonymized.

Checked rather than remembered, because the failure is silent. A fixture pasted from a
real install looks exactly like a fixture somebody wrote, and by the time anyone notices
it is in the history.
