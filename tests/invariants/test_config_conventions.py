"""Config names follow the convention, and no old name stops resolving.

`docs/conventions.md` mandates snake_case for JSON, and the settings file is JSON. It
drifted anyway: every key was snake_case while ten of seventeen sections were not, because
nothing checked. A one-time tidy decays the same way, so the rule is asserted here rather
than remembered.

The second half matters more. Every rename keeps its old spelling working forever, which
is only true while the alias exists - and an alias is exactly the kind of line that looks
dead to whoever is cleaning up. Dropping one should fail here, not on a user's upgrade.
