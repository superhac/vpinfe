"""The settings reference in the docs is the schema, not a copy of it that drifts.

`docs/technical_details.md` had gone stale in four directions at once: it named the file
`vpinfe.ini` after the move to JSON, listed sections and keys under names three renames
had replaced, and documented the pre-3.0 input vocabulary. Nobody was wrong to miss it -
a rename touches the schema and a reader would have to know the doc restates it.

So the reference is generated, and this fails when the file and the schema disagree.
Regenerate with `python3 -c "from tests.support import config_reference as r; r.write()"`.
