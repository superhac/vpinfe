"""A closed set of named variants is a kind, and `type` is reserved for borrowed words.

`docs/conventions.md` settles this: media kinds, job kinds, asset kinds are **kinds**, in
identifiers and in the JSON we write. `type` survives only where somebody else already chose
the word - Python's own, HTTP's, a library's parameter, or a key already sitting on disk.

The cost of not picking one is on the record. `MEDIA_SPECS` and `MEDIA_TYPES` were the same
closed set under two words, and the second had fallen seven kinds behind before anything
noticed, which cost a KeyError on upload and an empty filename on lookup.

This does not judge whether a name describes a closed set - nothing mechanical can. It
catches a *new* `*_type` identifier, so the question gets asked once, at the point where the
answer is cheap, rather than after two names for one thing have drifted apart.
