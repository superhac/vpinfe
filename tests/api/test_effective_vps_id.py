"""A corrected match is the game's id everywhere, and the discovered one is still said.

`4100685` set the contract: every top-level field on a game resource is the value in
force, and `discovered` carries what something outside VPinFE supplied so a surface can
name what an undo reverts to. `name` implemented it. `vps_id` reported the discovered id
on both sides, so a match somebody fixed by hand was stored, echoed back under
`overrides`, and then ignored by everything that reads an id - the entry shown, the
release count, the media offered.
