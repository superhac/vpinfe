"""What a library can be filtered on, over HTTP.

The five `get_filter_*` methods on the window channel had no HTTP equivalent, so a
client that was not a theme window could not learn what a filter collection could
filter by. This projects the same registry the resolver matches on, so an axis a
client is offered is one that will actually resolve.
