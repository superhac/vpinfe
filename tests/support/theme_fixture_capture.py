"""Captures the theme payload as JSON, so the JavaScript tests read what Python built.

The JS harness cannot import Python, and hand-written JS fixtures drift from the builder
silently - which is how a media key lookup shipped broken. So the payload is captured
here and committed; `tests/theming/test_theme_fixtures.py` fails when the committed copy stops
matching, and regenerating it makes the JS tests run against the new shape.

Not a test. Regenerate deliberately:

    python tests/support/theme_fixture_capture.py

Absolute paths are rewritten to a fixed root, because a temp directory would change the
fixture on every run and the URL builder only reads the last few segments anyway.
