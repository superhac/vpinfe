"""The settings reference in `docs/technical_details.md`, rendered from the schema.

The doc had drifted four ways at once - it named the file `vpinfe.ini` after the move to
JSON, listed sections and keys under names three renames had replaced, and documented the
pre-3.0 input vocabulary. Hand-editing it after every rename is what did not happen, so it
is generated and a test fails when the file and the schema disagree.

`config_schema` owns the content; this owns the table.

VPinFE stores its settings as JSON in a platform-specific configuration directory. On
first run it writes a complete `vpinfe.json` there, so a new install never needs the file
opened by hand:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/vpinfe/vpinfe.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/vpinfe/vpinfe.json`
- **Windows**: `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\vpinfe\\vpinfe\\vpinfe.json`

A `vpinfe.ini` from an earlier build is read once, converted, and kept, so downgrading
still works. Settings live under a `settings` object beside a `schema` version, and each
heading below is a key in it - `windows.playfield` is a `playfield` object inside a
`windows` object.

Every name a setting has ever had keeps resolving, so an older file and a hand-edit that
uses an old spelling both still load.
