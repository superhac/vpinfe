"""Helpers the asset upload tests share.

The upload path is tested from four angles - what the analyzer recognises, what a plan
proposes, what an import writes, and what a session holds - and each of them builds an
archive and reads the same three things back off a result. Those live here so splitting
the tests by angle did not copy them four times.
