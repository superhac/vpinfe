"""The suite must not be able to power off the machine running it.

This is not a hypothetical. A test wired VPinFE's real lifecycle performers and asked for
a system stop, and a developer's Mac went down mid-run with no prompt - the confirm hook
is off by default, so nothing stands between the request and the command. It happened a
second time from a check meant to prove the guard worked, which ran the suite with the
guard removed.

So these ask the guard rather than triggering it. `subprocess.Popen(["poweroff"])` inside
an assertRaises is not a test of a safety net, it is a test that only passes because the
net is there - and on the run where it is missing, the machine is already going down by
the time the assertion fails.

The guard itself is in `tests/__init__.py`, which every test imports through.
