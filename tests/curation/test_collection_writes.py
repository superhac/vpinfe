"""Two surfaces writing collections do not lose each other's edit.

The whole file is rewritten on every save, so a writer that read it before another one
saved is holding a stale copy - and writing that copy back drops the other's collection
while reporting success. The theme's collection menu, the API, the Manager UI and the
launch tracker all write the same file through stores of their own, so the window is
reachable from any pair of them.

`mutate` is what closes it: reload and save happen under one lock, so a writer's copy is
current for as long as it is being edited.
