"""Renaming a collection used to leave `general.startup_collection` behind.

The setting holds a name because a collection has no id to hold instead. So renaming
one the frontend was set to open on left the setting naming something that no longer
existed - and the failure was quiet: the frontend logged it and showed the whole
library, which is what it also does when the setting was never set at all.

Deleting one had the same shape: the setting kept naming it. That clears instead of
following, which is the same outcome the frontend already fell back to, said out loud.

These pin the following, not the storage. A collection id would make the whole problem
go away and there is no id yet.
