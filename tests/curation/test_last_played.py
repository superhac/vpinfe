"""Last Played derives itself from the play dates, instead of being maintained by hand.

The launcher used to push a game id onto the front of a member array on every launch and
trim it to 30. It is an ordinary filter collection now, so the cases that matter are the
conversion of a file that still holds the old array, and the promise that the conversion
happens exactly once - a user who deletes the collection, or turns it back into a list
they picked, must not find it rebuilt at the next start.
