// The theme documentation, checked against the code it documents.
//
// docs/theme.md is what a theme author builds against, and it drifted: doing this by hand
// once found four documented keys nothing serves and thirteen served keys nobody
// documented. A doc that names a method core does not have is worse than no doc, because
// the author writes the call and gets `undefined` at runtime.
//
// The examples are fragments, not programs - they reference `vpin`, `document` and a
// `currentGameIndex` that only exists in the surrounding prose - so running them is not
// the check. Three things are, and each one is a way the doc goes wrong:
//
//   1. every example parses, so a typo in the docs is a red build
//   2. every `vpin.<name>` the doc calls exists on the class
//   3. every payload path the doc reads exists in the captured payload
//
// The reverse direction - what we serve and never documented - is reported rather than
// failed, because "not written about yet" is a judgement and this file should not be the
// one making it.
