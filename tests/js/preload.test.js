// Core preloading, judged by how many requests it makes.
//
// The measurement behind this capability: a held key repeats about 30 times a second, and
// Revolution fetched 12 images per step, so a two-second hold asked the browser for
// roughly 700 images that were obsolete before they decoded. The fix is not fetching less
// per step - it is not fetching until the wheel stops. So the assertion that matters is a
// count over a burst, not the contents of one batch.
