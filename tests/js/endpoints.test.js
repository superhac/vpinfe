// Six places hardcoded 127.0.0.1 and read a port off the core, so "which machine answers
// this" was asserted six times and a seventh was easy to add. The block answers it once,
// keyed by role - hub and player, not by transport, because the window channel is one
// transport serving both and a transport-keyed block cannot express the split.
//
// Ports arrive in the url because the page cannot ask for them: asking needs the bridge,
// and finding the bridge needs a port.
