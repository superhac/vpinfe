"""Saying what this install is, on the network, and hearing what else is out there.

Announced rather than reported. An install says who it is on the LAN and every other
install decides for itself what to do with that, so nothing registers itself anywhere -
which is what lets a machine that only launches games carry no address for a machine
that manages it.

The announcement carries identity and nothing else: who this is, what it is called, what
it is for, and which build. Capabilities do not fit a TXT record and stay an HTTP fetch
for a peer somebody has decided to care about.

A home LAN is the assumption, and it is the one that makes this fine. Anything on the
network can claim to be a VPinFE install, so what comes back from here is a list of what
said it was there - untrusted input, not a record of anything deliberate.

Multicast is not everywhere. Some networks filter it, it does not cross a Docker bridge,
and Windows asks the first time a process binds. So this is best effort throughout: a
network that refuses costs discovery, never a startup, and manual entry stays.
