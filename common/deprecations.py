"""Every compatibility shim 3.0 carries, declared in one place.

3.0 renames a lot of names a user or a theme already depends on, and each rename left a
shim behind so nothing breaks. Those shims grew one at a time, in the module that needed
one, and by the end nobody could answer three questions about them:

  - what is there?          eight mechanisms, in six files, found by grepping
  - is it written down?     four had a PAR id; PAR-24 was cited in a handoff and did
                            not exist, so the window messages shipped half-done
  - can it ever be removed?  only one announced itself, so there was no evidence about
                            who still relied on any of the others

This module answers the first, and `tests/test_deprecations.py` turns the second into a
failing test rather than an intention. The third needs the shims to say something when
they are used, which is `announce()`.

Nothing here changes behavior. Each entry points at the code that already does the
forwarding; this is the description of it, kept next to nothing else so it cannot drift
into being a partial list.
