"""The commands that run around VPinFE itself.

The other pair in the set brackets a table; this one brackets the whole run. A launcher
has no opinion about VPinFE starting, so there are three slots and not four, and these
two are install settings that happen to share a mechanism with the table ones rather
than one feature with a scope on it.

There is no game, no launcher and no entry here, which is the first real test of tokens
being declared per context: a line written for a table is refused by name if it is
pasted into one of these.
