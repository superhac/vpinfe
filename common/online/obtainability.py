"""Whether a link VPS lists is a file you can go and get.

A listing is not a download. Three answers - `available` is one artifact, `reference` a
page that is not a download, `collection` somewhere to browse.

**`restricted` is deliberately absent.** Whether a host will serve this account cannot
be told without asking it, so `available` means "the catalog lists a file" and never
"it is yours to take".

Signals in the order they are trusted: the shape a host writes a folder in, then a bare
site root, then repetition across records - which is the backstop for what no shape
says, and is kept at a high threshold because a release page legitimately shared by a
handful of tables is not a collection.
