"""The registry: which apps this install has.

The built-in source is code that ships with the program, so it cannot fail to be there -
`generic` has to exist for an install whose everything else is broken to still be
configurable. A loaded source arrives later and only ever adds, which is why everything
reads through `all_apps()` rather than a constant frozen at import time.

Two `apps` packages: this one is core's registry, the top-level `apps/` holds the
implementations.
