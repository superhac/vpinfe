"""What an app must answer to play an entry.

An app is the program that plays something; a launcher is a configured wrapper around
one and holds the values for the fields the app declares. This module is the whole of
the boundary: an implementation under `apps/` imports it and nothing else of ours.

Seven capability groups. `claim` and `kinds` are declarations every app makes; `format`,
`launch`, `config`, `capability` and `capture` are behavior, and None is a real answer for
each. Consumers ask before they call.

Nothing here takes or returns a VPinFE object, and nothing holds a word. An app's words
are in `i18n/<language>.json` beside it, found by what the app declares: `name`,
`field.<key>.label`, `field.<key>.description`, `field.<key>.help`, `group.<key>.label`,
`group.<key>.heading.<heading>.label` and `.note`, and `group.<key>.pair.<pair>.label`,
`.note` and `.joiner`.
