"""Every kind of media a game can have, and how to find one on disk.

The kind names follow Visual Pinball's window names - `playfield`, `backglass`,
`scoreview` - because a window name *is* a media kind here, and VPX is where those names
come from. The files never moved: `bg.png` and `dmd.png` are what VPinMediaDB ships and
what everyone has on disk, and the contract 1 payload attributes are frozen too. Kinds
renamed, files frozen.

`MEDIA_SPECS` is the declaration the rest of the tree reads: each kind's name, its
attribute on a game, the filename it resolves to and the tokens it accepts. Naming
a kind is what contract 2 hands a theme; the path is ours and stays here.
