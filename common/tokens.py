"""What a user's command can say, and what each thing stands for.

Declared, the way settings are: each token says what it is, what it resolves to, and
where it is available. Declared rather than assembled at the call site because a surface
that offers them has to be able to list them - the difference between a feature people
use and one they guess at.

Three rules matter more than the list.

**Substituted into an argument, never into the line.** A line is split into arguments
first and each argument is resolved on its own, so a path with a space in it is one
argument. Resolving first and splitting after is how the same path becomes two arguments,
or worse.

**An unknown name refuses.** Resolving it to nothing turns `--config {launcher_ini}` into
a dangling flag that the program reads as whatever comes next. Not knowing a name and
having no value for one are different answers and both are said out loud.

**A name an extension brings carries its id.** `{vpinplay.player}`. The registry builds
the dotted half from the manifest; core's own names stay bare.
