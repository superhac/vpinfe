"""How a user has arranged a UI, kept with the library so it follows them between
machines.

Deliberately not `managerui/services/ui_state.py`, whose contract is that losing it
costs one notice being shown twice. A column layout someone tuned is worth more than
that, so this is its own file with its own durability expectation, and it is not in
`revert_3x.CONFIG_FILES` - a state reset is about 3.0 data, not about throwing away
how somebody likes their tables.
