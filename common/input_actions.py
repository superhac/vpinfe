"""Input produced by something that is not the browser.

The keyboard and the gamepad both reach the frontend from inside the page. This is the
third producer: a caller says a player pressed something, and the install puts it on the
bus for the windows to answer. What an action *means* is `common/input_registry.py`; this
is only how one arrives.

A hold is a press and a release, never a discrete action repeated on a timer. Put the
timer in the caller and the acceleration curve has to live in every caller, and then
holding "next" feels different depending on whether you held a flipper, a key or a thumb.
One gesture, one curve, one place - and the place is the frontend, which already has it
for the keyboard.

Which is why a press expires. A release can be lost - a phone locks its screen, a network
drops - and a lost release is a wheel that spins until somebody notices. The press carries
a time to live, the caller renews it while the input is held, and the install releases on
its own if the renewal stops coming.
