"""An app an extension provides, and how one is assembled from what it hands over.

**An extension cannot import the app contract**, and should not have to: its one door is
`common.extensions.contract`, which is what makes the boundary checkable. So a provided
app is described in plain data - an id, a name, the suffixes it plays, the fields a
launcher of it holds - plus one callable that says how to run something.

That keeps the contract free to grow. A dataclass an extension constructs is a shape it
is pinned to; a dict core reads is one core can add to without breaking anybody.

What a provided app does not get is the rest of the app contract - parsing a table,
resolving a ROM, a configuration surface. Those are declared as absent rather than
half-answered, the same way `apps/generic` declares them, because an app that claims to
parse and does not is worse than one that says it cannot.
