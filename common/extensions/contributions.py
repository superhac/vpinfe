"""Data an extension contributes about a game, fetched by core and never by the browser.

A theme reads `entry.ext.<key>`. It does not know which extension filled it in, and no
extension gets a method of its own on the theme surface - the alternative, which is what
exists today for one vendor, needs a new call for every connector that follows.

Core makes the third-party call. A page that reached out itself would put somebody else's
endpoint in every window on the cabinet, fetch the same answer once per screen, and lose
the lot on a reload.

Held per process, so one fetch serves every window and survives a page reload. Nothing is
persisted: a rating is somebody else's current answer, and a stale one read off disk at
startup would be worse than none.
