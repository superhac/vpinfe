"""2.x's VPinPlay profiles, answered from core's guests.

2.x shipped `get/set/clear_temporary_vpinplay_profile` to themes and a Multi page to hold
several visitors' VPinPlay accounts for a session, one of them active. Both stay, over the
guests core keeps: a profile is a guest holding a VPinPlay account, and the first of them
up is the active one.
