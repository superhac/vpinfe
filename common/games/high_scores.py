"""A machine's high score table, as VPinFE last read it off the machine.

The `.info` keeps one record per ROM under `User.HighScores`. The ROM is the machine: two
tables on one ROM share its table, and a mod on a ROM of its own keeps its own.

A record is `{read_at, score_kind, entries | value, new}`: the reading as
`score_parser.result_to_jsonable` gives it, without its ROM (the key says it), when it was
read, and `new` - the positions of the entries the last game put there.

Imports nothing beyond the standard library: the score parser, the metadata module and the
migration all read it.
