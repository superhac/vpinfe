"""A wire entry wearing the shape the metadata accessors read.

Filtering and sorting read `meta_config` off a `Game`. A client holding a copy of the
library has no `meta_config` - it has entries, whose fields the hub already resolved.
Rebuilding the sections those fields came from lets the same axis registry and the same
sort keys answer on both sides.

`name` arrives already resolved, including any `alt_title` and any leading article the
hub moved. Putting it back under `Info.Title` is safe only because moving an article in
a title that has had one moved is a no-op.
