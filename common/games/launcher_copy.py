"""Copying a launcher to another machine.

A copy, not shared storage. Launchers stay per install because what one names is a
program on one machine, and sharing is what you do when several cabinets are built the
same way.

**The copy keeps the id.** That is the whole trick: ids come from the generator every id
in this project uses, so they do not collide across machines, and preserving one means
the same launcher exists on every cabinet under one name and a mapping means the same
thing everywhere. Renumbering on the way in would break every mapping that travelled
with it.

**One way, with no ongoing link.** Edit a cabinet's launcher afterwards and it diverges,
and nothing here reconciles that. Real sync means conflict resolution, change tracking
and a rule about which side wins; growing that accidentally is worse than designing it.

A path that does not apply to the target announces itself: that machine's own path check
marks the program missing and its trouble badge lights, which is the machinery that
already exists for a launcher pointing at nothing.
