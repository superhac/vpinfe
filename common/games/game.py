These names are ours. The contract 1 payload publishes several of them under camelCase
keys a published theme reads - `game_dir_name` goes out as `gameDirName` - and those keys
are frozen by the parity gate. The key and the attribute are separate things:
`frontend/game_state.py` maps one to the other, and `media_specs` carries both.
