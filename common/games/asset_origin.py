"""Who put a file in a game folder, as far as anyone recorded.

Not the same question as tier. Tier says why a file is the one being used and is derived
from its name every run; origin can only be known because something wrote it down. Art
hand-placed at the fixed name reads as tier `default` exactly like a download.

The ledger is the only source cheap enough per request. Proving a file is the one
vpinmediadb publishes means hashing it, which belongs in a pass that can take its time.
