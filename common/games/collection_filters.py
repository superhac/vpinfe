"""Every axis a filter collection can constrain, declared once.

One definition per axis drives four things at once: what
a stored filter may contain, how it matches, what control the Manager UI renders, and
what the API's schema says. Adding an axis is an entry here.

Because the registry is the only place that knows the axes, a stored filter naming one
this build does not have is *detectable*: the collection is refused by name instead of
silently resolving to a different membership. That is what makes adding an axis free -
an older build degrades loudly rather than quietly answering the wrong question.

The rule that keeps it free: **axes are append-only and their meaning never changes.**
Different semantics get a new axis. `tests/test_collection_filters.py` holds a snapshot
that fails if an existing definition moves.
