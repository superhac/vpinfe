"""An app for a program VPinFE genuinely does not understand.

A binary and arguments, and an entry that is either a file or a key its program knows
how to look up. No parsing, no ROM resolution, no configuration surface, and no way to
tell when a session ended.

It is an app rather than a special case so that answering almost nothing is declared and
visible instead of discovered. It is also the contract's test case: two implementations,
one deliberately poor, is how we find out where the contract quietly assumed Visual
Pinball. It must never grow knowledge of a particular program - the first `if` on a
program's name is where the boundary dies, and a program worth special-casing has earned
its own app.
