"""Reading Visual Pinball's own settings file, and writing one back.

The file documents itself. Every setting VPX knows carries a comment above it giving the
label, the description, the default, and - where the answers are a closed set - what each
value means:

    ; Output Mode: Disabled, floating, or embedded [Default: 'Disabled', 0='Disabled',
    ; 1='Floating', 2='Embedded in playfield']
    BackglassOutput = 1

So the schema is read rather than authored, and a setting VPX adds in a later build
appears without anything here changing. 1133 of the 1195 keys in a current file carry
one.

Writing keeps the file's own shape: a value is replaced on the line it is already on and
nothing else moves, because the comments are the only documentation these settings have
and rewriting the file from a parse would throw them away.
