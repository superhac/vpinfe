"""What a PinballY library remembers about playing.

A play count and a last-played date are the part of a library somebody actually misses
when they move machines: a collection that sorts by either is wrong on arrival without
them, and nobody can reconstruct them by hand.

`GameStats.csv` sits beside the frontend and is UTF-16 with a BOM, which is the same
trap its ini carries - read as UTF-8 it fails outright. Every column is text and most
are empty, so a blank is the normal case rather than a malformed row.
