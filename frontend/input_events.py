"""Carrying a press from the bus to the windows.

`common/input_actions.py` decides what a press is; this puts it where the browser can
answer it. Registered once per process against the shared bridge, for the same reason
`play_events` is: every API instance sends through the same one, so registering per
window would send each press three times.

Broadcast to every window rather than aimed at one. Python does not know which window is
the controller and should not learn - that is browser-side knowledge, and core's dispatch
already branches on it. Aiming from here would make one press three presses on a
three-screen cabinet, or make this file track window roles.
