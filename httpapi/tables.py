"""Every table in the library, as its own lens on it.

A game's row cannot tell its tables apart - that is the whole of what this is for. A
folder holding four .vpx files collapses to one row under Games, and the questions that
are actually about a file (which is the default, which is out of date, which has its own
art) have nowhere to be asked.

Not a replacement for the game lens. Identity and shared media are the game's, and saying
so four times over is worse than saying it once. These are peers: the library seen by
folder, or seen by launchable file.
