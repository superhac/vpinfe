"""Manufacturers: the logo lookup made visible.

One row per distinct manufacturer string - every name VPSdb knows plus any the
library carries - with the slug it computes, the alias currently redirecting
it, the logo that resolves, and how many library tables wear it. `logo: null`
rows are the to-do list for anyone building a logo pack or migrating their
own; `aliased_to` is the only way to see a pack alias bypassing a user file.
