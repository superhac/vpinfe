"""Collections: the groupings a user makes over their library.

Two kinds behind one resource. A **manual** collection stores an explicit list of game
ids. A **filter** collection stores criteria and resolves to whatever matches when you
ask - so it has no member list to add to, and `PUT .../games/{id}` on one is refused
rather than silently doing nothing.

`common/games/collection_ops.py` is what answers. Here is the wire: the path, the scope,
the model, and turning a request's filter block into the criteria the store reads.
