"""What a surface says about a media file, in one vocabulary.

Two axes, and they answer different questions. **Tier** is whose file it is: the names
are the resolver's own, where a *table* is one .vpx and a *game* is the folder holding
them, and its five tiers collapse to four states here since two of the distinctions are
about our filename conventions and not about anything a user has a concept for.
**Source** is who put it there, which nothing about the file itself can say - only a
record can.

Six surfaces said the first of these five different ways before this existed, because
each new one invented its own words.
